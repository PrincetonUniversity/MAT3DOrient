# MAT3DOrient

This code contains the MATLAB code used to make the numerical simulation figures for the case of the Cramer-Rao lower bound for the division-of-amplitude polarimetry experiment. The example script shows a simple case of what can be done, further experimentation may be scripted using the class functions in the 'CommonFunction' folder from there.
